<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samuel Koome, an 20 year old male from Meru, Kenya. I'm a student who is currently pursuing my diploma in IT 
  but also teaching myself web development for my background knowledge on fullstack web development. Since joining secondary school 
  i had so much passion for computer studies so i did it for the 4 years i spent there. After finishing my secondary level education i 
  joined a certain institute named "Modcom Institute of Technology" 
  where i was introduced to coding and i really liked to create websites.</p>

<p>
  Everytime i get on google and search something up there is always 
  something related to it that pops up. There are always websites 
  that assist with the knowledge you need. How i enter a website and 
  use it smoothly and later helps me to achieve what i was intending to do, 
  gives me the motivation to create my own and show my family and friend how 
  it functions. Also, to be able to research problems facing people and find the 
  solutions to the problems then figuring out the solutions.Since joining secondary 
  school and got introduced to coding, i've always wanted to learn how to become a 
  web developer and i have hope i'll be able to accomplish my goals of becoming a professional web developer.
</p>

<p>While developing a website i like to first get a background knowledge 
  about the topic then research on it and see the impact it might bring 
  then implement my skills in developing a workable software to help solve 
  people's needs. Outside coding i also love to listen to music and spending 
  time with my friends. Within the next 3months i want to perfect my skils on 
  fullstack and develop more project and try applying for jobs. i want my skills 
  to help me financially and also help others out to make the world a better 
  place as days go by. I also want to make my family proud.</p>
